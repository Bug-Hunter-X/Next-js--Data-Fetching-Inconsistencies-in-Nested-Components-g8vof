# Next.js Data Fetching Inconsistencies in Nested Components

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Next.js related to data fetching inconsistencies when using `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps` within deeply nested components.  The problem stems from the asynchronous nature of these functions and how data propagation can be affected by component rendering timing.

## Problem

The provided code shows a scenario where a nested component attempts to access data fetched in a parent component's `getServerSideProps`.  Due to the asynchronous nature of the fetching operation and the way Next.js handles rendering, the nested component might not receive the expected data, leading to unexpected behavior or empty values.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the data is properly passed down through props.  Using a loading state mechanism also improves user experience by indicating data fetching progress.
